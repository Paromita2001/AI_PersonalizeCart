# AI_PersonalizeCart - Shop Smart with AI: Your Personal Shopping Buddy!

Welcome to **AI_PersonalizeCart**, an awesome project from Team AI_PersonalizeCart! This is our entry for the "Hack the Future: A Gen AI Sprint Powered by Data" during Data and AI Week. We’ve built a smart shopping assistant that makes online shopping fun and easy for you, and helps sellers too!

## What’s This About?
This web app uses AI to:
- Give you personal product picks and size help.
- Show eco-scores for green shopping.
- Help sellers guess demand and set prices.

It’s powered by Ollama AI, React, Flask, and SQLite, using `customer_data_collection` and `product_recommendation_data`.

## Team
- **Team Name**: AI_PersonalizeCart
- **Team Leader**: Paromita Karmakar

## How It Works
- **For Shoppers**: Get tailored recommendations, smart carts, and eco-scores.
- **For Sellers**: Get demand forecasts, pricing tips, and inventory help.
- **Tech Magic**: Ollama AI talks to helper agents to make it all smooth.
